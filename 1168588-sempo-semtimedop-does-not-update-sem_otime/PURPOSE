Description of problem:
System function semop() (orsemtimedop()) does not update time of semaphore update (structure sem_otime) which is inconsistent with function description:

# man semop
(...)
       On successful completion, the sempid value for each semaphore specified
       in the array pointed to by sops is set to the process ID of the calling
       process.  In addition, the sem_otime is set to the current time.
(...)

Our development is using it to check if process is alive, and overseers are stating that it is not, and are killing everything one by one.
